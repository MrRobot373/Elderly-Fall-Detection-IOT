# Elderly-Fall-Detection-IOT

# Excited to share a recent project on Elderly Fall Detection, combining cutting-edge technology to enhance safety and monitoring! ðŸŒŸ

Our system comprises two devices designed to detect falls and provide timely alerts:

# ðŸ“· Camera System:

â€¢	Utilizes an ESP32-based camera with tilt and pan functionality (controlled by two servo motors) to cover a large area.
â€¢	Live footage can be accessed via an IP address.
â€¢	Integrated with Blynk for remote control of the cameraâ€™s motion, ensuring comprehensive monitoring.

# âŒš Wrist Band:

â€¢	Equipped with an MPU6050 sensor and ESP8266 for precise motion detection.
â€¢	In the event of a fall, the system generates an immediate notification to a designated number, ensuring prompt assistance.

This project showcases the potential of IoT and real-time monitoring to create safer environments for the elderly. By combining camera surveillance with wearable technology, we aim to provide a robust solution for fall detection and timely intervention.
